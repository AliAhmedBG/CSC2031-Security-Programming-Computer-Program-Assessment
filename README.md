# CSC2031 – Flask Security Coursework

this file will show any references to outside sources where I learned how to implement features:
=================================================================================================
- Flask documentation
- SQLAlchemy documentation for parameterised queries
- Flask-WTF documentation
- weekly practicals
- used previous coursework as a reminder to how I did previous features

Issues:
=======
- I attempted to complete task I however it kept breaking previous parts and causing conflicts of my code and due to 
time constraints I decided to not implement it so other tasks aren't affected negatively
